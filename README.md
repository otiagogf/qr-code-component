## My processes

### Built with 
- Semantic HTML 5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive design

### What i learned?

#### I managed to put a little responsiveness into practice, adjusting the front of my solution for a mobile device, so I was able to test directly in the browser simulating the mobile and also directly on my phone, where my solution was pleasant for these devices.

```css 
@media screen and (min-width: 320px) and (min-height: 800px) {
    body {
        display: flex;
        justify-content: center;
        align-items: center;
        min-height: 100vh;
    }

    main {
        display: flex;
    }

    .card {
        width: 315px;
        height: 484px;
    }

    .card img {
        width: 280px;
        height: 280px;
    }
}
```

### Continuous development
#### I used the native github tool, which is github pages where in the [links](#links) section you will find the path to the active page.
